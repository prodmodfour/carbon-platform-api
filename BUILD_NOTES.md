# Build notes

AUTOMATION_STATUS: IN_PROGRESS

## Current summary

T003 is complete. The API now has Pydantic Settings loaded from `CARBON_API_` environment variables, standard-library structured JSON logging, request ID middleware, and documentation for the new configuration and observability behavior. `GET /healthz` still returns `{"status":"ok"}` and now includes an `X-Request-ID` response header; supplied request IDs are propagated.

## Last completed ticket

T003 — Config and structured logging.

## Current blockers

None.

## Quality gate history

2026-05-13:
- T001: `make test` — passed.
- T001: `make lint` — passed after formatting `src/carbon_platform_api/main.py` with Ruff.
- T001: `make typecheck` — passed.
- T001: `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — passed with Ruff, mypy, pytest, and coverage.
- T002: `uv run ruff check .` — passed.
- T002: `uv run ruff format --check .` — passed.
- T002: `uv run mypy src tests` — passed.
- T002: `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` — passed with 4 tests and 100% coverage.
- T002: `docker compose config` — passed.
- T002: `sudo -n docker compose build` — passed. `sudo` was needed in this environment because the current user does not have direct Docker socket access.
- T002: `sudo -n docker compose up --detach` — passed; `api`, `postgres`, and `redis` reached healthy/running states.
- T002: `curl --fail --silent http://localhost:8000/healthz` — returned `{"status":"ok"}`.
- T002: `sudo -n docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans` — passed.
- T002: `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — passed with Ruff, Ruff format check, mypy, pytest coverage, and `docker compose config`.

2026-05-15:
- T003: `uv run ruff check .` — passed.
- T003: `uv run ruff format --check .` — passed.
- T003: `uv run mypy src tests` — passed.
- T003: `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` — passed with 10 tests and 96% total coverage.
- T003: local Uvicorn startup check — passed; `GET /healthz` returned `{"status":"ok"}`.
- T003: `sudo -n docker compose build` — passed.
- T003: `sudo -n docker compose up --detach` — passed; `GET /healthz` returned `{"status":"ok"}` with `X-Request-ID` from the API container.
- T003: `sudo -n docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans` — passed via cleanup trap.
- T003: `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — passed with Ruff, Ruff format check, mypy, pytest coverage, and `docker compose config`.

## Limitations

- Only `GET /healthz` is implemented as a business/API endpoint.
- FastAPI docs/OpenAPI routes remain disabled by default; they are exposed only when `CARBON_API_DOCS_ENABLED=true`.
- PostgreSQL and Redis are available as local Docker infrastructure only; the application does not connect to them yet.
- No SQLAlchemy, Alembic, database models, Redis application code, carbon calculations, external API clients, authentication, metrics endpoint, or additional business endpoints are included.

## Notes for next cycle

Recommended next ticket: T004 Database models and migrations, if it is unlocked in `BUILD_TICKETS.md`.
